        "Hello, and thanks for stopping by! My name is Joshua Loew, and I'm passionate about software, product design, photography, and bicycles.",
        "I have nearly three years of software engineering experience as a consultant and freelance developer.",
        "Recently, I built a bike from the frame-up and completed a solo ride on the Great Divide Mountain Bike Route. The GDMBR is a network of forgotten trails, forest service roads, and public land that connect to form a 2,700 mile off-pavement cycling adventure spanning from Canada to Mexico along the spin of the Rocky Mountains.",
        "In my spare time, I like to hone my photography skills. I have an affinity for shooting landscapes, and I often prefer to expose and process analog film over digital becuase it forces me to be more thoughtfuland intentional while I'm in moment instead of deferring creative decision until I'm back at my computer.",
        "If you have any questions, please ask away. I hope you enjoy my work!"
